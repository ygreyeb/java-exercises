# Singleton pattern

## Prompt
Create a Singleton class that has a non-parameterized constructor. The class should have one public variable called str. It should also have a static method called getSingleInstance that will return the single instance of the class.

## Solution
Not much to say. Super simple exercise of creating a class that instantiates with singleton pattern.
